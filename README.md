# Boston Housing Price Prediction using Lasso Coordinate Descent Regression
# Overview
This project analyzes the Boston Housing Dataset to predict housing prices using Lasso Coordinate Descent Regression. The dataset includes various housing attributes in Boston, with the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) as the target variable. The Lasso algorithm uses coordinate descent to update coefficients, performing feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error, with results visualized through scatter plots and feature importance charts.

# Introduction
The Boston Housing Dataset is a benchmark for predictive modeling, offering extensive information about housing characteristics and prices in Boston. This project uses Lasso Coordinate Descent Regression to build a predictive model for estimating housing prices based on the dataset's attributes.

# Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset contains 506 observations with 13 attributes, including socio-economic and environmental factors. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

# Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Check and address missing values.
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates and irrelevant features.
Feature Scaling: Standardize numerical features.
Feature Encoding: Encode categorical variables if necessary.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution and relationships of features.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features using statistical techniques.
Model Selection: Choose Lasso Coordinate Descent Regression and compare with other algorithms.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters using grid search.
Model Training: Train the Lasso regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using mean squared error (MSE) and other metrics.
Interpretation: Interpret the coefficients and analyze the results.
# Results
No Missing Values: Ensures a reliable foundation for analysis.
Scatter Plot: Positive correlation between actual and predicted prices.
Residuals Distribution: Mostly random errors with a slight positive skew.
Feature Importance: Key features include house size and proximity to highways.
